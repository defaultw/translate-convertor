### Translate Convertor
This is a plugin that replaces the Chinese characters in the i18n file with the corresponding translated characters.

### Usage
Source file is the string of 'key=value' and translate file is the string of 'key= translated string '. This plug-in replaces the 'value' in the source file with the translated string.

'complete log' When you select 'enable', you can output the detailed log (the unconverted 'value' in the source file, and the number of rows in it).
